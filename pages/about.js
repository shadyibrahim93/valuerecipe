          <p>
            Where simple cooking meets smart technology — built to help you make
            the most of every ingredient.

          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            {BRAND_NAME} began with a simple idea: great food shouldn’t require
            expensive ingredients, complicated techniques, or hours in the
            kitchen. As a developer who loved experimenting in the kitchen, I
            often found myself overwhelmed by recipe websites full of clutter,
            ads, or unclear steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted something better — clean, efficient, and built around the
            things home cooks actually need. So {BRAND_NAME} was created with a
            mission to blend smart technology with practical cooking guidance,
            helping millions cook confidently at home.

            surprisingly simple — no matter your skill level. Our vision is to

          <h3>Why the Name "RekaDish"?</h3>
          <p>
            **RekaDish** is a unique name that blends the English word "Dish"
            with the Māori word **"Reka,"** meaning **"tasty," "sweet," or
            "pleasant."**
          </p>
          <p>
            We chose RekaDish because it succinctly captures our mission:
            providing a delightful, high-quality cooking experience (Reka) for
            every meal (Dish). It signifies that our recipes are vetted for
            maximum flavor and pleasure, making every dish a guaranteed success.
